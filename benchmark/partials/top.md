# Benchmarks

These benchmarks are auto generated using `./benchmark/run.sh`.

```
brew install hyperfine
pip install matplotlib
./benchmark/run.sh
```

I have put together what I believe to be equivalent commands in dasel/jq/yq.

If you have any feedback or wish to add new benchmarks please submit a PR.
